# [KIK-Site](https://emperorarthurix.github.io/KIK-Site/)
A simple, handcrafted web platform to manage your tasks and help you remain punctual!


## Inspiration

Our semester project prompts us to develop a website using the fundamental web tech stack, and we wished to incorporate something useful into our project. Instead of creating a looks-only page, we thought of bringing in utility by allowing anonymous users to type stuff and make use of a timer to track their work!


## What it does

The goal of the page is to allow users to write down stuff, and if they want to, they can time it.
A task management and short-term reminder application.

> More features might be on the way once we implement the basics properly, so that we can progressively build upon them.


## How we built it

This is a collaborative project and we used Visual Studio Code to work on it together.

Our workflow was monitored on GitHub, in this repository. Creating `issues` and assigning them to collaborators helped us keep track of our project status and keep improving the results.

## Challenges we ran into

- This time, we had to work in triplets instead of quadruplets. We had to part with one of our go-to team members, nonetheless, we maintained good communication with them and shared ideas
- Our first week was a little tough, as we tried to realise our task and keep things in order. We overcame it by conducting meetings for collaboration.
- Our first idea for the project title was supposed to be a fun-oriented one, but later we realised that our evaluators shall be from varying backgrounds, and we must conform to a more formal approach for the final evaluation. We had to re-think the project theme.
- Although we are using a familiar tech stack, there are many new features we have yet to learn in order to be able to achieve the goal we have set. We are still trying to figure out how.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Animated, smooth, fluid background
- Static `Contributors` Table and page, listing details of each of the collaborators
- Navigation bar with transition and hover effects

## What we learned

- Animating elements in CSS
- Using color palettes
- Maintaining a theme throughout various pages
- 'Good practices' for HTML Structure
