        <p>
            Online Classes are a combination of video recordings and live lectures with course reading and tests. They are generally conducted using a virtual portal through which students gather reading materials, interact with teachers and classmates, view grades, and monitor progress.

        <p>
            This type of class got a boost during the pandemic. With the global spread of the disease COVID-19, all the educational institutes had to shut down and were forced to conduct classes via the internet. But to avail the benefits of these classes it is recommended to have a good stable internet connection.
